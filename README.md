# alphabet-arabic-Handwriting recognition uesing CNN  

# Background

Handwriting recognition is a computer vision problem that involves a computer identifying handwritten
script and transforming the text from sources such as documents or touchscreens into a
machine-understandable format. The input image can be offline (from a piece of paper or a photograph)
or online (from a digital source, such as touchscreens).
Handwritten text in each language has a wide range of patterns and styles, which are influenced by
factors such as age, background, native language, and mental state. Various machine learning methods,
such as K-nearest neighbors (KNNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), transfer learning, and deep
learning techniques such as Neural Networks (NNs), have been extensively investigated in the field of
automatic handwritten recognition. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently been used in
the majority of studies.
Arabic writing is semi-cursive and written from right to left, with 28 characters in the alphabet. Because
each character has multiple shapes depending on its position in the word, automatic handwritten
recognition of Arabic script is more difficult than in other languages. Because of these factors, automatic
handwritten recognition of Arabic script is more difficult than in other languages.

## Objectives:

This task aims to introduce the challenges and techniques of Arabic Handwritten
Character Recognition (AHCR) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Here are some main
objectives

● Building a Basic CNN for AHCR, which includes:

✔ Network architecture: define a basic CNN architecture with convolutional layers, pooling

layers, and activation functions.
✔ Loss function and optimization: Introduce the concept of loss functions (e.g., cross-entropy)
and optimizers (e.g., Adam) for training the CNN.

✔ Training and evaluation: Guide students through training the model on a provided dataset

and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy.
✔ Visualization: Instruct students to visualize the CNN model's performance, such as the loss
curve.

Exploring advanced techniques, including:
✔ Explore the use of pre-trained models: Consider incorporating pre-trained CNN models
(e.g., VGG16) and fine-tuning them for AHCR.

✔ Touch upon more advanced architectures: Briefly mention deeper and more complex CNN architectures like ResNet or DenseNet and their potential in AHCR.


For each model you trained, you need to plot the following:
1. Training loss vs. epoch.
2. Validation loss vs. epoch.
3. Training accuracy vs. epoch.
4. Testing accuracy vs. epoch.
